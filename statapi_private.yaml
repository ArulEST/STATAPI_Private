      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Orders module is designed to streamline the management of orders within the application. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints and functionalities that allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete orders. This module serves as the backbone for order processing, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for the customers and administrators. 
      
      
      Key features of the Orders module include: 


        •	**Order Creation:** Users can submit new orders through dedicated endpoints, specifying essential details such as collection and delivery location, quantities and price and tracking information. 
      
      
        •	**Order Retrieval:** Retrieve detailed information about existing orders, including order tracking number, status, collection and delivery location, and customer details. 
      
      
        •	**Order Modification:** Update order information, such as quantities, signature flag through secure and straightforward endpoints. 
      
      
        •	**Order Deletion:** When necessary, users can cancel orders, and the module handles the necessary updates and notifications. 
      
      
        •	**Order Status Tracking:** Easily monitor the status of orders, from creation to shipment and delivery, enabling real-time order tracking for customers and staff.

      # Solution Approach
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective is to enhance the performance of our application by optimizing response times. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate the seamless integration of a high-volume client into our application, we use Cosmos database that significantly improved response times, reducing the processing time for order requests. 
      <h3><b>Concept</b></h3>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the user hits the new endpoint, it interacts with Cosmos, creates a temporary record and returns the response to the user with a standard set of information. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A distinct process is executed which retrieves the temporary records from Cosmos and generates an order in SQL DB. 
      
      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/flowchart.png" />

      <h3><b>Validation with Header-bound API keys </b></h3>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the header-bound API keys, the validation is performed. When a vNext order creation endpoint is triggered, the API Key Message Handler validates the API key from the request header against the key available in the Cosmos DB, which currently serves as the central repository for API key validation. 
      
      <h3><b>Workflow Procedure</b></h3>
     
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the validation fails due to the non-existence of the API key in the Cosmos DB, the process halts, triggering an exception with the message "API key is invalid". 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the request header key is validated, using STAT base API controller, the customer API key, feature flag and price set of the customer have to be fetched from the cosmos DB.
      
      <h3><b>JSON Validation</b></h3>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step is to verify the input JSON, by checking whether the order endpoint holds the serviceable zip code and valid price set.  
        
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Zipcode validation</b> - With the predefined conditions stored in the Cosmos DB, the zip code will be checked if it comes under the serviceable proximity region. 
        
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Price set validation</b> - If the customer has the valid price set, the order request will be stored in the Cosmos DB.  

      <h3><b>Results:</b></h3>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Success</b> - When the zip code and price set validation succeed, a success response is generated confirming the order creation. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Failure</b> - However, if the validation fails due to zip code or price set, the order request is not stored, and the system generates the exceptions as a response. 
     
     
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Zip code error response</b> - Either this order's delivery zip code is not serviceable at all or it cannot be serviced from your local service area. Please contact STAT customer service if you believe this to be inaccurate. We apologize for the inconvenience.
     
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Price set error response</b> - Selected price set not available at this time. Use api/PriceSets to get current list of available customer price sets.

      <h3><b>Master data that exists in Cosmos:</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer API key</li>
          <li>ZipCodes</li>
        </ul>

      # Code Snippet  

      <h3><b>Order creation</b></h3>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order request header key is verified against the API key in Cosmos DB. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the key is found in Cosmos DB, the isvalid status will be set to True.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the key is not found in Cosmos DB, the request header key is then checked against the ASP Net user table ID in the SQL DB. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the validation is successful, the isvalid status will be set to True. 



      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_1.png" />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the validation is unsuccessful, verify whether the Bearer token is present in the header and that the parameter is not empty. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Bearer token is absent, examine the header for parameters with the keys "type," "wise," and "scheduler." If any one of these parameters is present, set isvalid to true. 


      
      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_2.png" />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an order is initiated from the STAT Portal, the CustomerId found in the header is employed to authenticate the endpoint request. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the customerid is found in the SQL table, the isvalid status is set to true. 

      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_3.png" />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If none of the above mentioned conditions are met, and if the endpoint is "api/OnTimeUpdates," isvalid will be set to true. For all other endpoints, isvalid will be false, and the response returned will be "Api Key Not Valid." 

      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_4.png" />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify the API key in Cosmos DB and confirm whether the retrieved key exists in the customer API key table. If it exists, associate it with the API key list; if not, raise an exception “Something went wrong. Please contact STAT support” 

      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_5.png" />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Validate the Create Order request values against the collection and delivery location details. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, verify that the address Line 1, City, State, and Postal code are valid. If any of these details are invalid, send the respective exceptions. 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, ensure that the "Deliverysignaturerequired" condition is true, the "isadultsignature" condition in the orderDTO is also true, and the signature type is not empty. All these conditions collectively indicate that the order is ready to be placed.  

      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_6.png" />
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Validate if the delivery zip code falls within the serviceable region and if there is a valid price set for the customer.

      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_7.png" />
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all the above conditions are met, "Create Order" values are stored in Cosmos DB. 

      <img src="https://arulest.github.io/STATAPI_Private/Codesnippet/vNEXT/OrderCreation/vnext_order_8.png" />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate the response to be sent.
